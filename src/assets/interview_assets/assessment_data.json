  "description": "At the end of each phase, you will find an assessment activity which contains everything you need in order to assess a child\u2019s phonological awareness upon completion of the phase.\nThese  assessments  do  not  have  a  standardised  pass  rate  but  are  designed  to  be  used as part of your day to day formative assessment to inform your next steps for every child. As a general indicator, a child should be able to recognise and pronounce the majority of graphemes and phonemes in the phases they have completed.\nThese assessments are also useful as a baseline assessment, to assess new children to your school or children that you may have concerns about.\n<strong>Graphemes &lt;th&gt; and &lt;oo&gt;</strong>\nIn Phase 3, children learnt that the grapheme &lt;th&gt; can be said with either an unvoiced /th/ (thief) or a voiced /th/ (that). Similarly, the grapheme &lt;oo&gt; can be either a short /oo/ (Ook) or a long /oo/ (Oon). When covering these graphemes in the assessment, you can accept either pronunciation as correct. ",
