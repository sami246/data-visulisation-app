Notes:
- Changes to assessment_scores data to seperate information from sounding_out_and_blending to keep everything uniform
- Would also remove the 'default' nesting however didn't want to change too much about original data
- Two different views for child or parent/teacher where the former doesn't show fellow students scores to avoid unhealthy competiton
